UNINTEGRATED LIGHTS OUT (UiLO)

Just like HP's Integrated lights out,
but with a few options. ;)


======================================
Components used:
1- Arduino Uno R3
2- Relays
3- Ethernet Shield
======================================
Be careful if you're going to connect high voltage trough the relays,
The best option is to put all the dangerous stuff in a box.

Peace.
